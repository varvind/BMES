<h1 style="text-align: center;">BMES Participation Tracker Help Page</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>This is the user documentation for the TAMU BMES Participation Tracker Website. TAMU BMES is the Biomedical Engineering Society at Texas A&amp;M University. They have engaged our company in order to create a web application that they will use to track member attendance at organization events.</span></p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span>--------------------- </span><b>Event Sign In Area</b><span>---------------------</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>The website consists of two main areas, the </span><b>event sign in</b><span> area and the </span><b>club officer</b><span> area. Upon first visiting the website, the user should be taken to the home page, which appears as so:</span></p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span><b>Home Page:</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span><b><img src="https://i.ibb.co/F6sm9j8/Landing.png" alt="" /></b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Item 1A: The club officer login button. Left clicking on this button will redirect the user to the sign in page for the </span><b>club officer area</b><span> where they will be asked for both a username and password. If a club member/ individual without login credentials mistakenly navigates here, they will be able to return to the </span><b>home</b><b>page</b><span> with the back button in their web browser.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Item 1B: The events panel. This panel contains all of the events hosted by the club, sorted by date, with most recent dates displayed at the top of the list. Events that occurred over 2 days ago will disappear from this panel in order to help prevent the home page from becoming too cluttered, but all events will always be visible from the </span><b>club officer area</b><span>. Please note that each individual event has its own unique &ldquo;Details&rdquo; button and its own unique &ldquo;Event Check-In&rdquo; button.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Item 1C: The event details button. Left clicking on this button will redirect the user to the </span><b>event details page, </b><span>where they will be able to get a better view of the event information.

They will be prompted for different fields including their name and email address so that their attendance will be properly counted. Users will be able to return to the </span><b>home page</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using the back arrow in their browser, or by clicking the home button on the top left of the page.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note: We have left in the framework for a future web developer to add a feature that would allow the website to support club officer password reset by email.
